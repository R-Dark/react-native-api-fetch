# react-native-api-fetch

This is a React Native mobile app that will fetch from an API upon component loading, and map through and display the data. 
Once the data is fetched and displayed, you can then click the "buy now" button that leads to the product Amazon listing. 

Through builiding this app, I learned the convenience and value of creating reusable components via passing props rather than 
hard-coding values. I also made attempts to get the CSS styles as polished as posssible, in order for these components to be
long-term assets when building mobile applications. 

Finally, I learned how to "link" to other apps within the mobile device (the mobile browser, in this instance).
